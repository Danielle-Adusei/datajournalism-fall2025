# DC Crime Rate

1. The interesting question I answered was what was the UCR-Ranking near the McDonalds on Wisconsin avenue? This could meet the standards of newsworthiness for AU audiences because McDonalds near the campus  is a frequent eating spot for AU students, especially after late night parties.

2. Some steps that I took to answer this question was first finding out what a UCR-Ranaking is and what does each ranking mean? After finding that I made the pivot table. For that I decided to put in the rows the BLOCK, offense key, and the offense group( For the offense key and offense group I just wanted to know the crime). For values I added the Sum of ucr-rank. 

3. The answer for my question is  18 and 3. Within DC( specifically wisconsin avenue) we have ad one violent assault with a deadly weapon ( rank 3) and one auto/property theft( rank 18).
