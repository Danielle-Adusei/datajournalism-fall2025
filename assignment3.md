# DC Crime Rate

1)The interesting question I answered was what was the UCR-Ranking near the McDonalds on Wisconsin avenue? This could meet the standards of newsworthiness for AU audiences because McDonalds near the campus  is a frequent eating spot for AU students, especially after late night parties. 

2)Some steps that I took to answer this question was first finding out what a UCR-Ranaking is and what does each ranking mean? After finding that I made the pivot table. For that I decided to put in the rows the BLOCK, offense key, and the offense group( For the offense key and offense group I just wanted to know the crime). For values I added the Sum of ucr-rank. 

The answer for my question is  18 and 3. Within DC( specifically Wisconsin avenue) we have had one violent assault with a deadly weapon ( rank 3) and one auto/property theft( rank 18).

# Final Project Data

1)Link to the orginal dataset: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/drug-overdose-death-rates-by-drug-type-sex-age-race-and-hispanic-origin-united-states-3f72f

2)For our data set we did not have to clean the data due to the data being thoroughly organized. 

3)A question that I wanted to answer was How many men from the ages of 15-24 died of drug overdose and what drug had the highest count of deaths compared to women. I felt as if this would be newsworthy because it’ll show us which gender is more susceptible to do drugs and lead us to other questions such as how we can provide care for people that may be going through drug addictions and how mental health plays a part in drug addiction.

4)The steps I took to answer this question are for the pivot table I plugged in age and stub_lable as filters ( to get the specific age and gender), panel in the row, and the sum of estimates in values ( to get the total of the estimated deaths).

5)My answer for the first part of my question was 528 ( not rounded: 528.1) and the drug with the highest count of deaths for men was opioids. For women in the age of 15-24 the death total is 195 (not rounded: 194.7) and the drug with the highest count of deaths  was also opioids.

On our topic, the data on overdoses in Maryland from 2015-2025 we've identified a dataset that can be used for our research. This dataset is the  U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, Drug overdose death rates, by drug type, sex, age, race, and Hispanic origin: United States,  that was updated in April of 2025. We’ve analyzed the data and the necessary process of learning what each category is and what it stands for. A problem that we had looking for datasets for drug overdoses was looking for ones specifically in Maryland that were connected to fentanyl deaths and overdose. For the sake of time and effort we will most likely make a broad search for drug overdoses in the United states that gives details like the current dataset we are using.With making our topic more board we were able to find news articles that coincide with our topic such as The New York Times covering Baltimore’s drug epidemic, the Washington Post covering on how DC in 2024 has seen the worst cases of opioids deaths, and many more. For the sample set, I would more likely look at major cities due to the diverse population. One thing that we did not do, that we were in the process of doing, is finding more data sets from major cities to see their data on drug related deaths. This will be useful to our final project because it’ll show what major cities have the highest death count and why might be the reason for that.

One high quality data set that we found was from the Maryland department of health data office. This source has gathered data from September 2024 to now on drug deaths related to fentanyl, opioids, and many more drugs. It also tells us the counties in which drug deaths occurred. This source is trustworthy due to other news organizations using this data as references, it's a government site, and it gives us information on not only drug deaths but also overdose visits, Ems treatment, and Naloxone administered patients the state has come across within the last year. The only limitation of this data set is that there is no data for 2025. The only reason for this is because they probably update the data every year.

Another high quality data set we've found was from the Baltimore City Overdose Needs Assessment Dashboard. This data set is trustworthy because it's coming from researchers from the Baltimore city health department, they’ve come out with a letter from the mayor to the residence discussing the crisis,  and they reference and cite the sources they’ve gotten the data from. This data set seems to have no limitations.

The last quality data set comes from U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. This data set includes drug overdose death rates by race, sex, age, which drug caused the death, and Hispanic origin. This data set is trustworthy mainly because it's a government based data set. A limitation of this data set is how detailed it is. Due to how much data is on it and all the categories, it can be hard to read on the first try.
