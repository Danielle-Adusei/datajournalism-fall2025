# Summary for Editor

For my topic, the data on overdoses in Maryland from 2015-2025, Iâ€™ve gathered several articles and data sets that explains cases from its peaks, what drugs contributed to the peak, and the trends over the years. Media outlets such as Maryland Matters and The New York Times describe how Maryland's drug overdose death has contributed to Maryland official leaders finding ways to fix the issue. The Mayland Matters article goes more in depth on how cases as recent as of 2024 have seen a 30% decrease in overdose deaths. The New York Times explains in depth how Baltimore city has seen the most drug overdoses in Maryland.

What hasn't been done or brought up in these sources is the efforts on how drug overdoses in Maryland have decreased. The data shows the decrease but the articles give either little to no in depth expulsion of how the stats have been decreased. The Maryland Matters article briefly quotes the CDC of them saying that public intervention is the reason for the decrease in deaths. While the New York Times article doesn't mention the decrease in deaths.

# Datasets 

The dataset from the Maryland.gov website gives us a visual representation of drug overdoses In Maryland. This dataset is trustworthy because it is a government site as well as it only focuses on Maryland related incidents. A limitation of this dataset is that the furthest I can go is September 2024 and it doesn't show great details such as race, sex, and gender affected by this addiction.

The dataset from the Maryland Opioid Operational Command Center pdf gives us a detailed yet overview of overdose deaths in Maryland.
