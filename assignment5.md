**Lede**

The reporter used a vignette‐style lede. The lede started off with a clear description of a car driving off a cliff in Colorado at night. This is an effective way of engaging the reader because this one sentence leaves the reader with questions of the events, how it happened, what it means, and how it relates to the title and topic of the article. This lede will also invoke emotions such as pity, confusion, and sadness to the audience. 

**Data**

The analysis involved going through government data such as the CDC, the Census Bureau from 2021, and many more local hospital records try try to get an accurate number of their stories.According to the article, their findings, “An estimated quarter of all Americans live further than a 30-minute drive from Level I or II trauma centers, which provide the highest level of care to injured patients. In rural areas, the risk of death is greater due to longer response and transport times, research shows.” I do wonder if they were to add the most common way to die within these states for a data set would this give the audience an understanding of how important time is when someone is in an emergency.

**Sources**

The story integrates human sources by interviewing people within the area to speak on their experience on first responders' trivial time. Their testimonials were aligned with the reporters' findings from the data. In the article, a local to the Dallas  area claimed that it's a known fact that if you live within the backcountry, you are essentially by yourself if you get in trouble. This helped the story because it gave real people experience, not only a story and data.

**Story Structure**

Some techniques that the story used were Vignettes, Inverted pyramid, and Circle/bookend.

Vignettes: This was the most noticeable story technique as well as the first. The lede started off with a clear imaginable situation with only vivid words. Later on in the article, it gives little descriptive sentences such as “We’re at 9,000 feet here, and we’re constantly flying over 14,000-foot mountains,” letting descriptive words and phrases humanize the problem. 

Inverted pyramid: After the Vignettes technique, the Inverted pyramid can be seen. This technique was used in the sixth paragraph stating “Each year, medical researchers estimate tens of thousands …decried as a health crisis.” The article presented the most important facts first, then supported it with data, stories, and testimonials.  

Circle/bookend: The beginning of the article started off with an uterine situation. The car drove off a cliff into a ravine. The article ended off with a more detailed ending that continued with the victim getting the care he needed due to the first responder arriving.


**Numbers**

The writing about the data was clear and engaging. If this article did not have any data visuals, this article will still give the audience a clear understanding of the descriptive language used. They don't overcomplicate their data findings. When they first introduced the phrase “pre- to in-hospital death ratio” it was confusing. I felt as if the article should've given a sentence or two to break down the phrase so the reader could understand it without having to figure it out on their own. 

**Data Viz**

The data visualization adds the unfortunate visual realization of how scare trauma centers in rural America. The article does a great job with color schemes, using colors such as red to represent critical scarceness in rural America. The article also does a good job in explicitly telling the audience what each data visualization is showing us. The data visualizations were very necessary. Despite them all being on the same topic, each visualization was a sub topic. For example, after the author wrote the section on rual-urban divide then showed the audience a visualization on states ratios on pre- to in hospital deaths without having to repeat statements made in the section.

**Methods**

The author addressed the nuances of the data by clearly stating things. For example, when transporting patients from where they sustained their injuries to the hospital, the article briefly talks about the timeless within getting from point a to point b also depends on the weather conditions. They further state that depending on the weather they may have to make camp with patients until weather conditions improve before they arrive back at the hospital. 


The author did use a nerd box. In my opinion, it was kind of necessary. The nerd box was used to tell the audience how long this investigation was and how rigorous and time consuming it was to find the data. It took one of the Journalists over 2 years to finally finish the story due to how long her findings took. 

**Etc**

In my opinion, the first map where it showed the trauma centers could have been in a different format. I do understand the visual appeal and the reasoning of making it into a map, but I felt as if we could have also used a list of where they were located mainly due to how laggy the map was.
